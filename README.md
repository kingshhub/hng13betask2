HNG Backend Task 2: Country Currency & Exchange API

A robust RESTful API built with Node.js, TypeScript, and Express, designed to fetch, process, cache, and serve global country data, currency exchange rates, and computed estimated GDP values.

The application adheres to a clean, layered architecture (Controller, Service, Entity) and uses TypeORM with MySQL for persistence.

 Stack and Technologies

Runtime: Node.js

Language: TypeScript

Framework: Express.js

Database: MySQL

ORM: TypeORM

HTTP Client: Axios

Image Generation: node-html-to-image (utilizes Puppeteer/Chromium)

Testing: Jest & Supertest

üõ†Ô∏è Setup and Installation

Prerequisites

Node.js (v18+ recommended)

MySQL Server (accessible locally or remotely)

node-html-to-image Requirements: If you encounter installation issues (especially related to Puppeteer downloading Chromium), you may need to set the PUPPETEER_SKIP_DOWNLOAD environment variable to true and install a compatible headless browser executable manually on your system, though the current setup is designed to be highly portable.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone <YOUR_REPO_LINK>
cd <PROJECT_DIRECTORY>


2. Install Dependencies

npm install


3. Database Configuration

Create a file named .env in the project root directory based on the .env.example file.

# .env file example
PORT=3000

# MySQL Database Configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_USER=root
DB_PASSWORD=enter_mysql_password
DB_NAME=country_cache_db

# External API URLs (Defaults)
COUNTRIES_API_URL=[https://restcountries.com/v2/all?fields=name,capital,region,population,flag,currencies](https://restcountries.com/v2/all?fields=name,capital,region,population,flag,currencies)
EXCHANGE_RATE_API_URL=[https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD](https://open.er-api.com/v6/latest/USD)


Note: The application uses TypeORM with synchronize: true for development, so the tables (countries and status) will be created automatically on the first run.
